    "This notebook will utilize the MNIST dataset to aid in training a neural network (NN) that can recognize digits. Its performance will then be test on some Sudoku puzzles, but it is expected as of now that it may not be perfect since this dataset containts handwritten digits. Sudoku puzzles are typically printed in a nicer fashion. Therefore, it may be wise to explore and expand the training dataset to also incorporate printed Sudoku puzzles. This may make it easier for the NN to then recognize puzzles that have been printed and partially filled in. "
